# Welcome to DupeTrace! 🕵️

Hey there, server admin! Welcome to **DupeTrace** – your server's new best friend in the eternal battle against dupers.

Think of us as the security guard who never sleeps, never takes bathroom breaks, and definitely never lets a sneaky player walk out with two identical enchanted netherite swords when they should only have one.

## What's This All About?

DupeTrace is a Minecraft plugin that tracks every non-stackable item on your server using invisible UUID tags (like tiny digital fingerprints). When the same item shows up in two places at once? We catch it. Fast.
